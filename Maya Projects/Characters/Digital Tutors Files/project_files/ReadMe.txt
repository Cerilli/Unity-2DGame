PL Studios, Inc. d/b/a Digital-Tutors ("Digital-Tutors" "we" "us" or "our") develops award-winning training solutions ("Training Materials") for emerging digital artists using a unique teaching approach designed by university educators and industry professionals and makes certain Training Materials available to users via the Digital-Tutors Web Site (the "Site") or platforms available from Digital-Tutors (the offering of services or Training Materials through the Site or other Digital-Tutors platforms are collectively referred to as the "Services"). Some Digital-Tutors Services are available to you for free, while others require that you create a User Account and pay a Subscription Fee for access. Access to and use of the Services, whether accessed with or without payment are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

By subscribing to the Services or creating a User Account, you also agree to the provisions of the Digital-Tutors Privacy Policy, available at http://www.digitaltutors.com/11/privacy_policy.php (the "Privacy Policy"), which are all incorporated herein by reference. This Agreement and Privacy Policy include important legal information, including the exclusion of certain warranties and remedies. You are responsible for reviewing this Agreement and the Privacy Policy. The Digital-Tutors Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time without specific notice to you; however, if we amend these terms, we will post the revised Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy on our Web site.

Accounts

In order to obtain access to the Services, you must create a Digital-Tutors account ("User Account") and pay the appropriate fees for access to the services you request. By creating a User Account, you represent and warrant the information you provide is accurate and complete. You may never use another's account or share your User Account with others. Except as expressly authorized for Floating Seats with respect to Group Accounts, an institution may not purchase a single user account and share that user account among multiple employees. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password and are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your User Account. If you believe your User Account has been breached or used in any unauthorized manner, you must notify a Digital-Tutors representative immediately. Digital-Tutors is not responsible for any damage or losses caused by unauthorized use of your User Account. You, however, may be responsible to Digital-Tutors for any harm Digital-Tutors incurs due to unauthorized use of your Digital-Tutors User Account.

Group Accounts

Digital-Tutors may provide access to its Site and Services through group accounts, which may be available to groups and institutions at the sole discretion of Digital-Tutors. Group accounts are managed by a "Group Administrator" associated with your affiliated group. If you are a member of a group account, the Group Administrator of your account is responsible for the payment of all fees and charges associated with your subscription. As a group account member, you will not be charged individually for fees or charges related to your use of the Site or Services. Unless otherwise stated in group account purchases, group account access will expire 12 months from the original date of purchase. Digital-Tutors may also terminate group accounts for cause or in accordance with the termination provisions of this Agreement. If you have questions regarding your group account, you must contact your Group Administrator. Digital-Tutors may provide "Floating Seats" for members of a group account. A Floating Seat is a license that may be used by a group of users without being specifically associated with a single individual, but only a single user may obtain full access to the Site or Services with a Floating Seat license at one time. Users may log on to the Site with a Floating Seat account. If that Floating Seat is in use, the user will be placed in a queue until the Floating Seat becomes available. When a seat becomes available, the first member in the queue will be notified and given access to the library. Group administrators and members can share the number of purchased group account seats meaning that multiple users can simultaneously login, browse, search and watch from Digital-Tutors online training library. Floating seats are only available within group accounts.

Subscription Fees

Digital-Tutors offers services on a subscription fee basis according to the pricing and payment schedule available at http://www.digitaltutors.com/11/pricing.php (the "Subscription Fees"). You agree to pay the Subscription Fees and any other charges incurred in connection with your User Account (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. If your subscription includes access to areas containing premium content or services, your access to such areas may be subject to additional fees, terms and conditions, which will be separately disclosed in such areas. We will bill all charges automatically to your credit card, PayPal account or other payment method that Digital-Tutors offers and you select. For any services billed by invoice, all payments are due net thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice.

Billing

Subscription Fees will be billed beginning on the day of the month in which Digital-Tutors activates your User Account (the "Subscription Date") and on the monthly anniversary of each Subscription Date thereafter for the Term of this Agreement and any renewal thereof. Unless we state in writing otherwise, all fees and charges are nonrefundable. We may change the fees and charges then in effect, or add new fees or charges, by giving you notice in advance. If you want to use a different credit card than one previously provided or there is a change in credit card validity or expiration date, or if you believe someone has accessed the Services using your user name and password without your authorization, you must contact us immediately. You are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access the Services through an Internet access provider or other third-party service. For example, the Services may include large video files. You are responsible for payment of any bandwidth, data, or subscription charges you may incur from a service provider while utilizing the Services.

Personal Information

When creating a User Account or using the Services, you will provide certain personal information to us ("User Information"). In addition to any provisions of our Privacy Policy, you agree that we may use your User Information to contact you regarding services we provide. We may also provide your e-mail address or contact information you provide to our affiliates for marketing our services. If you would prefer not to receive marketing or advertising, you must notify us by contacting us at cs@digitaltutors.com and requesting removal from our contact lists. Digital-Tutors uses a third party to process credit card purchases and does not retain records that include full credit card account numbers. Digital-Tutors may, however, obtain and retain portions, such as the last four digits, of a credit card number in order to later verify customer purchases.

Proprietary Rights

All Training Materials, content, organization, graphics, design, compilation, magnetic translation, digital conversion and other matters related to or included on the Site are protected under applicable copyright, trademark, patent or other proprietary (including but not limited to intellectual property) rights. The copying, modifying, distributing, transmitting, displaying, selling, licensing, using, publishing or creating derivative works by you of any such matters or any part of the Site, except as expressly allowed by the Agreement, is strictly prohibited. You do not acquire ownership rights to any Content or other materials viewed through the Site. The posting of information or materials on the Site does not constitute a waiver of any right in such information and materials.

Downloading Materials

Digital-Tutors may make certain Training Materials available through download services, including but not limited to downloads available through the Digital-Tutors Vault System. In order to access these Training Materials, you must agree to and comply with any end user license agreements or terms and conditions associated with the downloaded Training Materials as well as these Terms and Conditions.

Trademarks / Service Marks

These trademarks and/or service marks may not be reproduced without the express written consent of the respective trademark or service mark owner.

Term and Termination

This agreement shall be in effect as of the date you create your User Account. The term of the Agreement for billing purposes shall begin as of the Subscription Date. When selecting the Services, you may enroll on a monthly, semi-annual or annual basis. Your subscription will renew automatically unless we terminate it or you notify us by telephone, mail, or e-mail (receipt of which must be confirmed by email reply from us) of your decision to terminate your subscription. For subscriptions of six months or greater, we will notify you of the pending renewal of your subscription at least 30 days prior to the date your subscription renews, except as otherwise required by law. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees for the renewal term to your credit card.

Termination by You

You may terminate your User Account at any time by notifying us of your desire to terminate. After receiving notice from you, we will terminate your account before the Subscription Date for the next billing cycle for your Services. You will not receive a refund for any fees paid to Digital-Tutors.

Termination by Digital-Tutors

Digital-Tutors may terminate your User Account with or without cause and without notice when terminated for cause. If you believe your User Account has been terminated in error, contact Digital-Tutors at cs@digitaltutors.com. For example, Digital-Tutors may terminate a User Account, if it determines you have provided others with access to Training Materials with your User Account. If it is determined by Digital-Tutors, in its sole discretion, that your User Account was terminated in error, Digital-Tutors will provide you with access to the Services at no charge for the period of time in which your User Account was terminated. This shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to you for any termination in error. If Digital-Tutors terminates your account for cause, determined at the sole discretion of Digital-Tutors, you will not receive a refund for any Subscription Fees paid to Digital-Tutors. If Digital-Tutors terminates your User Account without cause, as determined by Digital-Tutors in its discretion, Digital-Tutors will provide you with a pro rata refund of payments made to you for the Services.
